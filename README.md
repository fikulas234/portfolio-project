# Front-End Portfolio
This is my main portfolio application. It is my first project in Next.js after finishing course on Udemy. The idea was file-based structure website, but there is still work needed style-wise.

## Tech stack:
ReactJS, NextJS, CSS modules

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| npm install  | Installs dependencies  |
| npm run dev  | Starts local dev server at localhost:3000  |
| npm run build  | Build your production site to ./dist/  |
