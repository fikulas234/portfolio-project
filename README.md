After finishing Next.js course on Udemy I wanted to create something unique from scratch and because I needed portfolio website anyways I decided to make it in Next.js. Because I wanted to make use of one of the next.js core functionalities - nested routing, I decided to make some kind of file-based website. As time goes on I will do some style changes to make it more appealing but this is it for now.
